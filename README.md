Phylogenetics is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among or within groups of organisms. \
The split decomposition method was one of the first methods that produces a network rather than a tree. Networks are more suited to display inconsistencies in noisy data and to model phenomena of reticulate evolution. \
Behind this method there is a rich mathematical theory about pseudo-metric spaces, whose central result is a theorem of decomposition of symmetric functions.

This is the result of the work for my bachelor thesis. \
You can read the original thesis in the file "Tesi_split_decomposition.pdf", and the most updated version in the file "main.pdf". \
There are all the file needed to reproduce the final output, except the university logo (which is not freely accessible). This was compiled locally with TeX Live 2024. \
In the folder "notes" there are some other topics that didn't make in the final thesis.

The Matlab code computes the split decomposition numerically. \
If you want to play with the networks, check out [SplitsTree](https://github.com/husonlab/splitstree6).
