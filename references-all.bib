    abstract = {We consider specific additive decompositions {$d = d_1 + \dots + d_n$} of metrics, defined on a finite set {$X$} (where a metric may give distance zero to pairs of distinct points). The simplest building stones are the split metrics, associated to splits (i.e., bipartitions) of the given set {$X$}. While an additive decomposition of a Hamming metric into split metrics is in no way unique, we achieve uniqueness by restricting ourselves to coherent decompositions, that is, decompositions {$d = d_1 + \dots + d_n$} such that for every map {$f : X \to R$} with {$f(x) + f(y) \geq d(x,y)$} for all {$x,y \in X$} there exist maps {$f_1, \dots, f_n : X \to \mathbb{R}$} with {$f = f_1 + \dots + f_n$} and {$f_i(x) + f_i(y) \geq d_i(x,y)$} for all {$i = 1, \dots, n$} and all {$x,y \in X$}. These coherent decompositions are closely related to a geometric decomposition of the injective hull of the given metric. A metric with a coherent decomposition into a (weighted) sum of split metrics will be called totally split-decomposable. Tree metrics (and more generally, the sum of two tree metrics) are particular instances of totally split-decomposable metrics. Our main result confirms that every metric admits a coherent decomposition into a totally split-decomposable metric and a split-prime residue, where all the split summands and hence the decomposition can be determined in polynomial time, and that a family of splits can occur this way if and only if it does not induce on any four-point subset all three splits with block size two.}

This method accurately dissects the given dissimilarity measure as a sum of elementary “split” metrics plus a (small) residue. The split summands identify related groups which are susceptible to further interpretation when casted against the available biological information. Reanalysis of previously published ribosomal RNA data sets using split decomposition illustrate the potential of this approach.}

For matrices with no triangles, columns sums {$\geq2$}, we find that the number of linearly independent row intersections is equal to the number of distinct columns. We then study the extremal (0, 1)-matrices with no triangles, column sums {$\geq2$}, distinct columns, i.e., those of size {$m\times\binom{m}{2}$}. The number of columns of column sum {$l$} is {$m - l + 1$} and they form a ({$l - 1$})-tree. The {$\binom{m}{2}$} columns have a unique SDR of pairs of rows with 1's. Also, these matrices have a fascinating inductive buildup. We finish with an algorithm for constructing these matrices.}

The {$L^1$} (or Manhattan) distance {$\lVert x - y\rVert_1$} between two vectors {$x = (x_i)$} and {$y = (y_i)$} in {$R^m$} is given by {$\lVert x - y\rVert_1 = \Sigma_{1 \leq i \leq m} \lvert x_i - y_i\rvert$}. A metric {$d$} is {$L^1$}-embeddable if there exist vectors {$z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n$} in {$R^m$} for some {$m$}, such that {$d_{ij} = \lVert z_i - z_j\rVert_1$} for {$1 \leq i < j \leq n$}. A cut metric is a metric with all distances zero or one and corresponds to the incidence vector of a cut in the complete graph on {$n$} vertices. The cut cone {$H_n$} is the convex cone formed by taking all nonnegative combinations of cut metrics. It is easily shown that a metric is {$L^1$}-embeddable if and only if it is contained in the cut cone. In this expository paper, we provide a unified setting for describing a number of results related to {$L^1$}-embeddability and the cut cone. We collect and describe results on the facial structure of the cut cone and the complexity of testing the {$L^1$}-embeddability of a metric. One of the main sections of the paper describes the role of {$L^1$}-embeddability in the feasibility problem for multi-commodity flows. The Ford and Fulkerson theorem for the existence of a single commodity flow can be restated as an inequality that must be valid for all cut metrics. A more general result, known as the Japanese theorem, gives a condition for the existence of a multicommodity flow. This theorem gives an inequality that must be satisfied by all metrics. For multicommodity flows involving a small number of terminals, it is known that the condition of the Japanese theorem can be replaced with one of the Ford–Fulkerson type. We review these results and show that the existence of such Ford–Fulkerson-type conditions for flows with few terminals depends critically on the fact that certain metrics are {$L^1$}-embeddable.}

Thus extensive use is made of the so-called neighbors relation associated with a dissimilarity index. Arbitrary dissimilarity data are then analyzed by comparing their neighbors relations with ideal, that is, tree-like relations: if it matches an ideal relation, then one can readily construct a tree representing the data that is optimal in a certain sense. Finally, some algorithms are proposed for fitting observed data to tree-like data.}

These clusters then form a closure system which can be described as a hypergraph without triangles. Conversely, given such a system, one may attach some weight to each cluster and then compose a similarity measure additively, by letting the similarity of a pair be the sum of weights of the clusters containing that particular pair. The original clusters can be reconstructed from the obtained similarity measure. This clustering model is thus located between the general additive clustering model of Shepard and Arabie (1979) and the standard hierarchical model. Potential applications include fitting dendrograms with few additional nonnested clusters and simultaneous representation of some families of multiple dendrograms (in particular, two-dendrogram solutions), as well as assisting the search for phylogenetic relationships by proposing a somewhat larger system of possibly relevant “family groups”, from which an appropriate choice (based on additional insight or individual preferences) remains to be made.}

He considers classes of more or less traditional problems arising in connection with families of flows sharing capacities of the same network. Such families, usually known as `multicommodity network flows', are referred to as multiflows. Only non-directed networks are considered. Moreover, the treatment is confined to situations which are `linear' in the sense that only linear constraints and objectives are considered for multiflow problems, and only real-valued solutions are being sought. Nevertheless, the author is particularly interested in integral, `half-' and `quarter-integral' solutions whenever they exist --- but only due to the nature of the problem and the method it is handled with.}

It is known that a distance matrix {$D$} of order {$n$} is tree-realizable if and only if all its principal submatrices of order 4 are tree-realizable. We discuss bounds for the number, denoted {$Q_i(D)$}, of non-tree-realizable principal submatrices of order {$i \geq 4$} of a non-tree-realizable distance matrix {$D$} of order {$n \geq i$}, and we construct some distance matrices which meet extremal conditions on {$Q_i(D)$}. Our starting point is a proof that a non-tree-realizable distance matrix of order 5 has at least two non-tree-realizable principal submatrices of order 4. Optimal realizations (by graphs with circuits) of distance matrices which are not tree-realizable are not yet as well known as optimal realizations which are trees. Using as starting point the optimal realization of the (arbitrary) distance matrix of order 4, we investigate optimal realizations of non-tree-realizable distance matrices with the minimum number of non-tree-realizable principal submatrices of order 4.}

    abstract = {The metric and dimensional assumptions that underlie the geometric representation of similarity are questioned on both theoretical and empirical grounds. A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features, and similarity is described as a featurematching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance.}

    abstract = {The close relationship between the theory of quadratic forms and distance analysis has been known for centuries, and the theory of metric spaces that formalizes distance analysis and was developed over the last century, has obvious strong relations to quadratic-form theory. In contrast, the first paper that studied metric spaces as such -- without trying to study their embeddability into any one of the standard metric spaces nor looking at them as mere `presentations' of the underlying topological space -- was, to our knowledge, written in the late sixties by John Isbell. In particular, Isbell showed that in the category whose objects are metric spaces and whose morphisms are non-expansive maps, a unique injective hull exists for every object, he provided an explicit construction of this hull, and he noted that, at least for finite spaces, it comes endowed with an intrinsic polytopal cell structure. In this paper, we discuss Isbell's construction, we summarize the history of --- and some basic questions studied in --- phylogenetic analysis, and we explain why and how these two topics are related to each other. Finally, we just mention in passing some intriguing analogies between, on the one hand, a certain stratification of the cone of all metrics defined on a finite set {$X$} that is based on the combinatorial properties of the polytopal cell structure of Isbell's injective hulls and, on the other, various stratifications of the cone of positive semi-definite quadratic forms defined on {$\mathbb{R}^n$} that were introduced by the Russian school in the context of reduction theory.}

    abstract = {Trees with positively weighted edges induce a natural metric on any subset of vertices, however not every metric is representable in this way. A problem arising in areas of classification, particularly in evolutionary biology, is how to approximate an arbitrary distance function by such a tree metric, and thereby estimate the underlying tree that generated the data. Such transformations, from distances to tree metrics (and thereby to edge-weighted trees) should have some basic properties such as continuity, but this is lacking in several popular methods, for example (as we show) in “neighbor joining.” However, a continuous transformation, due to Buneman, frequently leads to uninteresting trees. We show how Buneman's construction can be refined so as to lead to more informative trees without sacrificing continuity, and we provide two simple examples of its use. We also provide a sufficient condition for both the Buneman construction, and its refinement to correctly recover the underlying tree.}

Based on a natural conceptual framework, the book focuses on the interrelationship between the principal options for encoding phylogenetic trees: split systems, quartet systems, and metrics. Such encodings provide useful options for analyzing and dealing with phylogenetic trees and networks, and are at the basis of much of phylogenetic data processing. The book highlights how each one provides a unique perspective for viewing and perceiving the combinatorial structure of a phylogenetic tree and is, simultaneously, a rich source for combinatorial analysis and theory building. It is dedicated to Manfred Eigen who inspired many of the results presented in this book. Graduate students and researchers in mathematics and computer science will enjoy exploring this fascinating new area, and learn how mathematics may be used to help solve topical problems arising in evolutionary biology.}

However, when reticulate events such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer or recombination are believed to be involved, phylogenetic networks that can accommodate non-treelike evolution have an important role to play.

Beginning with a concise introduction to both phylogenetic trees and phylogenetic networks, the fundamental concepts and results are then presented for both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic networks. Current approaches and algorithms available for computing phylogenetic networks from different types of datasets are then discussed, accompanied by examples of their application to real biological datasets. The book also summarises the algorithms used for drawing phylogenetic networks, along with the existing software for their computation and evaluation.
