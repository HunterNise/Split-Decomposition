    abstract = {We consider specific additive decompositions {$d = d_1 + \dots + d_n$} of metrics, defined on a finite set {$X$} (where a metric may give distance zero to pairs of distinct points). The simplest building stones are the split metrics, associated to splits (i.e., bipartitions) of the given set {$X$}. While an additive decomposition of a Hamming metric into split metrics is in no way unique, we achieve uniqueness by restricting ourselves to coherent decompositions, that is, decompositions {$d = d_1 + \dots + d_n$} such that for every map {$f : X \to R$} with {$f(x) + f(y) \geq d(x,y)$} for all {$x,y \in X$} there exist maps {$f_1, \dots, f_n : X \to \mathbb{R}$} with {$f = f_1 + \dots + f_n$} and {$f_i(x) + f_i(y) \geq d_i(x,y)$} for all {$i = 1, \dots, n$} and all {$x,y \in X$}. These coherent decompositions are closely related to a geometric decomposition of the injective hull of the given metric. A metric with a coherent decomposition into a (weighted) sum of split metrics will be called totally split-decomposable. Tree metrics (and more generally, the sum of two tree metrics) are particular instances of totally split-decomposable metrics. Our main result confirms that every metric admits a coherent decomposition into a totally split-decomposable metric and a split-prime residue, where all the split summands and hence the decomposition can be determined in polynomial time, and that a family of splits can occur this way if and only if it does not induce on any four-point subset all three splits with block size two.}

    abstract = {The evolutionary history of species is traditionally represented using a rooted phylogenetic tree. However, when reticulate events such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer or recombination are believed to be involved, phylogenetic networks that can accommodate non-treelike evolution have an important role to play. This book provides the first interdisciplinary overview of phylogenetic networks. Beginning with a concise introduction to both phylogenetic trees and phylogenetic networks, the fundamental concepts and results are then presented for both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic networks. Current approaches and algorithms available for computing phylogenetic networks from different types of datasets are then discussed, accompanied by examples of their application to real biological datasets. The book also summarises the algorithms used for drawing phylogenetic networks, along with the existing software for their computation and evaluation. All datasets, examples and other additional information and links are available from the book's companion website at www.phylogenetic-networks.org.}

The main role of phylogenetic techniques lies in evolutionary biology, where it is used to infer historical relationships between species. However, the methods are also relevant to a diverse range of fields including epidemiology, ecology, medicine, as well as linguistics and cognitive psychology This graduate-level book, based on the authors lectures at The University of Canterbury, New Zealand, focuses on the mathematical aspects of phylogenetics. It brings together the central results of the field (providing proofs of the main theorem), outlines their biological significance, and indicates how algorithms may be derived. The presentation is self-contained and relies on discrete mathematics with some probability theory. A set of exercises and at least one specialist topic ends each chapter. This book is intended for biologists interested in the mathematical theory behind phylogenetic methods, and for mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists eager to learn about this emerging area of discrete mathematics.

Based on a natural conceptual framework, the book focuses on the interrelationship between the principal options for encoding phylogenetic trees: split systems, quartet systems, and metrics. Such encodings provide useful options for analyzing and dealing with phylogenetic trees and networks, and are at the basis of much of phylogenetic data processing. The book highlights how each one provides a unique perspective for viewing and perceiving the combinatorial structure of a phylogenetic tree and is, simultaneously, a rich source for combinatorial analysis and theory building. It is dedicated to Manfred Eigen who inspired many of the results presented in this book. Graduate students and researchers in mathematics and computer science will enjoy exploring this fascinating new area, and learn how mathematics may be used to help solve topical problems arising in evolutionary biology.}

A problem arising in areas of classification, particularly in evolutionary biology, is how to approximate an arbitrary distance function by such a tree metric, and thereby estimate the underlying tree that generated the data. Such transformations, from distances to tree metrics (and thereby to edge-weighted trees) should have some basic properties such as continuity, but this is lacking in several popular methods, for example (as we show) in “neighbor joining.” However, a continuous transformation, due to Buneman, frequently leads to uninteresting trees. We show how Buneman's construction can be refined so as to lead to more informative trees without sacrificing continuity, and we provide two simple examples of its use. We also provide a sufficient condition for both the Buneman construction, and its refinement to correctly recover the underlying tree.}

For matrices with no triangles, columns sums {$\geq2$}, we find that the number of linearly independent row intersections is equal to the number of distinct columns. We then study the extremal (0, 1)-matrices with no triangles, column sums {$\geq2$}, distinct columns, i.e., those of size {$m\times\binom{m}{2}$}. The number of columns of column sum {$l$} is {$m - l + 1$} and they form a ({$l - 1$})-tree. The {$\binom{m}{2}$} columns have a unique SDR of pairs of rows with 1's. Also, these matrices have a fascinating inductive buildup. We finish with an algorithm for constructing these matrices.}

The {$L^1$} (or Manhattan) distance {$\lVert x - y\rVert_1$} between two vectors {$x = (x_i)$} and {$y = (y_i)$} in {$R^m$} is given by {$\lVert x - y\rVert_1 = \Sigma_{1 \leq i \leq m} \lvert x_i - y_i\rvert$}. A metric {$d$} is {$L^1$}-embeddable if there exist vectors {$z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n$} in {$R^m$} for some {$m$}, such that {$d_{ij} = \lVert z_i - z_j\rVert_1$} for {$1 \leq i < j \leq n$}. A cut metric is a metric with all distances zero or one and corresponds to the incidence vector of a cut in the complete graph on {$n$} vertices. The cut cone {$H_n$} is the convex cone formed by taking all nonnegative combinations of cut metrics. It is easily shown that a metric is {$L^1$}-embeddable if and only if it is contained in the cut cone. In this expository paper, we provide a unified setting for describing a number of results related to {$L^1$}-embeddability and the cut cone. We collect and describe results on the facial structure of the cut cone and the complexity of testing the {$L^1$}-embeddability of a metric. One of the main sections of the paper describes the role of {$L^1$}-embeddability in the feasibility problem for multi-commodity flows. The Ford and Fulkerson theorem for the existence of a single commodity flow can be restated as an inequality that must be valid for all cut metrics. A more general result, known as the Japanese theorem, gives a condition for the existence of a multicommodity flow. This theorem gives an inequality that must be satisfied by all metrics. For multicommodity flows involving a small number of terminals, it is known that the condition of the Japanese theorem can be replaced with one of the Ford–Fulkerson type. We review these results and show that the existence of such Ford–Fulkerson-type conditions for flows with few terminals depends critically on the fact that certain metrics are {$L^1$}-embeddable.}

Optimal realizations (by graphs with circuits) of distance matrices which are not tree-realizable are not yet as well known as optimal realizations which are trees.

    abstract = {The close relationship between the theory of quadratic forms and distance analysis has been known for centuries, and the theory of metric spaces that formalizes distance analysis and was developed over the last century, has obvious strong relations to quadratic-form theory. In contrast, the first paper that studied metric spaces as such -- without trying to study their embeddability into any one of the standard metric spaces nor looking at them as mere `presentations' of the underlying topological space -- was, to our knowledge, written in the late sixties by John Isbell. In particular, Isbell showed that in the category whose objects are metric spaces and whose morphisms are non-expansive maps, a unique injective hull exists for every object, he provided an explicit construction of this hull, and he noted that, at least for finite spaces, it comes endowed with an intrinsic polytopal cell structure. In this paper, we discuss Isbell's construction, we summarize the history of --- and some basic questions studied in --- phylogenetic analysis, and we explain why and how these two topics are related to each other. Finally, we just mention in passing some intriguing analogies between, on the one hand, a certain stratification of the cone of all metrics defined on a finite set {$X$} that is based on the combinatorial properties of the polytopal cell structure of Isbell's injective hulls and, on the other, various stratifications of the cone of positive semi-definite quadratic forms defined on {$\mathbb{R}^n$} that were introduced by the Russian school in the context of reduction theory.}

    abstract = {This article argues for an affirmative answer to the question in the title. In future interactions between mathematics and biology, both fields will contribute to each other, and, in particular, research in the life sciences will inspire new theorems in “pure” mathematics. This point is illustrated by a snapshot of four recent contributions from biology to geometry, combinatorics and algebra.}
